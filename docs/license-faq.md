## Can I use it for my oss?

For all kinds of project, all core members with push access should have apppropriate license.

If you are building an open source software for end-users, you can use it if all core contributors of the project with push permission have appropriate license.

If you are building a library for developers, you can use it under some restrictions.
Just like other projects, all core members should have license.
And as an addition, all developers using your project should buy the license.
