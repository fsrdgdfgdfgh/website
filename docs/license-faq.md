For non-oss projects, all core members with push access should have apppropriate license.
If then, kind of license does not matter.

## Do I need to buy personal license even if I have business license?

No.
If you register your business account to your personal account, you will get personal license which can be used for your private projects.
In other words, if you are wokring on a compnay which buys the license for you, you don't have to buy it again.

## Can I use it for my oss?

If you are building a fully open source software for end-users (app, web server, website, etc..), you can use it if the license of your project is [approved by Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses)

If you are building a library for developers, you can use it under some restrictions.
All developers using your project with a closed-source project should have the license.
